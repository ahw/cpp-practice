With concrete types, their representation is a part of their definition. They resemble built-in types in the way they are managed in memory (held on the stack and automatically removed when out of scope).

An abstract type completely insulates a user from the implementation. To create an abstract type, decouple the interface and give up local variables. We don't know anything about the representation, even the size. Must allocate objects on the heap and access them through pointers and references.

```
class Container {
    public:
        virtual double& operator[](int) = 0
        virtual int size() const = 0
        virtual ~Container() {} = 0
}
```

* **virtual:** May be redefined later in a class derived from this one
* **pure virtual:** A class derived from Container must define the function
* **Abstract class:** A class with a pure virtual function
* Abstract classes often have no constructor (nothing to initialize)
* Abstract classes often have a virtual destructor. Derived classes must delete resources appropriately.
